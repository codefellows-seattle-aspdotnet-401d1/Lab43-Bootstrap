=====================================
  - This took me 2 hours.
  - I struggled with my Layout being unable to render a section in my Create and Edit pages. The section was unnecessary and for jQuery, so I just commented them out and now the Layout renders correctly.
  - I learned how to install bootstrap into an ASP.NET Core web app and use it to make my front end more visually appealing. 
  - I utilized bootstrap docs from microsoft, w3schools, and getbootstrap.com
